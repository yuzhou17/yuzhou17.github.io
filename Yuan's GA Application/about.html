  <h1>About Me</h1> 
  <h3>Hi there! My name is Yuan Zhou, and here are a few things I would like to tell you about myself:</h3> 
  <div> 
  <h2>Work and Education</h2> 
  <p>I am a graduate from the University of Calgary, with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. I am currently working as a AutoCAD field technician for a company called Excelsior, where I use a laser and tablet to draw floorplans for realtors and businesses.<br />Programming has always been a hobby of mine, so I want to take this opportunity, while work is slow, to learn how to make websites.</p> 
  <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2> 
  <p>- Piano: I have my level 10 certificate from the Royal Conservatory of Music. I taught piano at a music school full time a couple years ago, but now I come in as a substitute teacher once in a while<br />-Jewelry making: I have my own line of handmade crystal and hemp jewelry, and I sell them online and at street festivals in the spring and summer time. The brand is called Ruyie Jewelry<br />-Skiing: During the winter time I go almost every weekend!</p>
